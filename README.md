# weather-website


날씨


One of the first websites I built for fun to keep some HTML and CSS skills sharp.  Part of this project was to challenge myself in writing in another language.  The language I choose was 한글 (Korean).  With a basic forecast for a week, you see the high and the lows for the days as well as a discribtion of what the weather will be like that day.

BUILT WITH:
HTML
CSS
JAVASCRIPT

The bottom of the screen shows a popup cookie warning window that maybe dismissed by the agreement button in dark blue.  As well as a link to more informaiton on the warning if one so wishes to follow the link.

Another feature would be the popup alert for the citys on the top of the screen; London (란던), Seoul (서울) and Japan (일반).

The last feature in this simple example website I would like to highlight would be the change from celsius to fahrenheit for those of us who have lived in the states our whole lives and dont often use celsius, to tell the temps in these locations.
